## `createStandingOrder()`

```php

```

Create a standing order

To use this service PIS must be enabled by our customer support for your client.<br/><br/>If you are unlicensed, or licensed but using finAPIâ€™s Web Form, this endpoint is not relevant to you. Please use the endpoint <a href='?product=web_form_2.0#post-/api/webForms/standingOrder' target='_blank'> here</a> to initiate (create and also submit) standing orders!<br/><br/>Note that this service only creates a standing order resource in finAPI and there is no bank communication involved.<br/>To submit the standing order to the bank, call the 'Submit standing order' service

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: finapi_auth
$config = OpenAPI\Client\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');

// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: finapi_auth
$config = OpenAPI\Client\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');


$apiInstance = new OpenAPI\Client\Api\StandingOrdersApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$create_standing_order_params = new \OpenAPI\Client\Model\CreateStandingOrderParams(); // \OpenAPI\Client\Model\CreateStandingOrderParams | Create standing order parameters
$x_request_id = 'x_request_id_example'; // string | With any API call, you can pass a request ID. The request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters. Passing a longer string will result in an error. If you don't pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally. The request ID is always returned back in the response of a service, as a header with name 'X-Request-Id'. We highly recommend to always pass a (preferably unique) request ID, and include it into your client application logs whenever you make a request or receive a response (especially in the case of an error response). finAPI is also logging request IDs on its end. Having a request ID can help the finAPI support team to work more efficiently and solve tickets faster.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->createStandingOrder($create_standing_order_params, $x_request_id);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling StandingOrdersApi->createStandingOrder: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
```

## `submitStandingOrder()`

```php

```

Submit standing order

To use this service PIS must be enabled by our customer support for your client.<br/><br/>If you are unlicensed, or licensed but using finAPIâ€™s Web Form, this endpoint is not relevant to you. Please use the endpoint <a href='?product=web_form_2.0#post-/api/webForms/standingOrder' target='_blank'> here</a> to initiate (create and also submit) standing orders!<br/><br/>Submit a standing order to the bank which was previously created with the 'Create a standing order' service.<br/><br/>Before you submit the standing order, please check that the given bank interface supports the required PIS capabilities, otherwise the standing order could get rejected.<br/>In case the standing order is initiated from a given IBAN, please refer to the field BankInterface.paymentCapabilities to be sure the standing order you are creating is currently supported by the bank.<br/><br/>Usually banks require a multi-step authentication to authorize the standing order. In this case, and if the finAPI Web Form flow is not used, the service will respond with HTTP code 510 and an error object containing a multiStepAuthentication object which describes the necessary next authentication steps. You must then retry the service call, passing the same arguments plus an additional 'multiStepAuthentication' element.<br/>Please refer to the description of the HTTP 510 error code below and the documentation of the 'MultiStepAuthenticationCallback' response object for details.<br/><br/><b>ATTENTION:</b> For XS2A interface additional headers must be included in the request if the end user is involved. Please refer to the <a href='#general-user-metadata'>User metadata</a> section under 'General Information' of the API documentation.
